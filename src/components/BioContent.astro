      Welcome to DJ Otter Claw! I'm <span
        class="text-electric-blue font-semibold">Elliott Clark</span
      >, a professional DJ based in Franklin, Tennessee, bringing energy and
      expertise to events throughout Middle Tennessee and beyond.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      I've had the privilege of providing soundtrack to memorable moments across
      Middle Tennessee. Whether it's the gentle acoustic melodies during your
      wedding ceremony, the sophisticated background music for your corporate
      event, or the high-energy beats that pack the dance floor at your pop-up
      club night, I craft each musical experience with precision and passion.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-electric-blue mt-8 mb-4">My Story</h3>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Growing up in all around US, I developed a deep appreciation for music
      across all genres. From classic rock to modern EDM and hip-hop, I
      understand how different styles can transform the atmosphere of any space.
      This diverse musical foundation allows me to read the room and deliver
      exactly what your audience craves.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      My journey into professional DJ services began with a simple belief: <em
        class="text-neon-teal"
      >
        great music has the power to bring people together and create lasting
        memories</em
      >. Every event is unique, and I take pride in working closely with clients
      to understand their vision and exceed their expectations.
